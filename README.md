# Vigenère Cipher Solution (index.html) : 
This solution uses inline <style> and <script> tags to house all the necessary code in one file.
To create a single, web-based solution, I'll combine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one self-contained index.html file. You can save the code block below as index.html and run it directly in any web browser.



# Vigenère Cipher Web Tool (Client-Side) :
# Description
This project is a clean, client-side implementation of the classic Vigenère Cipher—a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, making it a lightweight, dependency-free tool that runs directly in any web browser without needing a server.

The application allows users to easily encrypt plaintext into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext back to the original message using a required alphabetic key. This tool is perfect for educational purposes or for a quick, secure demonstration of classical cryptography principles.

# Features : 
Encryption and Decryption Modes: Supports both forward encryption and reverse decryption using the mathematical Vigenère formulas.

Pure Client-Side Logic: No backend or server communication is required, ensuring fast performance and local execution.

Case Handling: Preserves the original case (upper/lower) of alphabetic characters in the input text.

Non-Alphabetic Preservation: Automatically ignores and preserves all non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers).

Modular Design: The core cipher logic is clearly separated in the JavaScript, based on the
